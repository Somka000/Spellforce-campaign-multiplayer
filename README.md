# Spellforce-campaign-multiplayer
Mod allows to playing in singleplayer or multiplayer campaign with Freegame gamemode

## Knows problems:

1. I can't play on xyz map again. 
It's rare problem with script duplication, before entering the map you chose you need to;
- enter other map,
- save game and quit,
- its done!

3. Some enemies bases don't exist as they did in original campaign.

  If you:
- choose normal or less enemies option - there's gonna be less enemies/ bases on the map.
- want to play with normal amount of bases choose option "more enemies".

5. High-tier chests have other loots.
You are still using gamedata created ONLY for multiplayer campaing, please load your old gamedata.
